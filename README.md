Why the friction?! and other pubescent designer mindset mysteries!

## Motivation

Folks on the spectrum are blessed and cursed with the uncanny ability to spotting contradictions. Pointing them out often goes misunderstood or worse, due to being blessed and cursed with the uncanny ability to be literally explicit, and human all the same.

The common denominator of our humanity, we err, in judgement and in communication. So while errors always take place in any communication, people will adapt to familiar patterns and autocorrect for them without even noticing. In most cases, people will not be able to immediiately attune to patterns that are unfamiliar, and while the message may not have any fault, they will not try to actually read it when they grew too accustomed to only gleening by patterns without realizing that they do.

The uncommon denominator of our humanity, how we judge. So while error often happens, people will not always judge the same way. Those on the spectrum will likely be judged wrong, not because they are, but because they are often pointing out detail that others do not usually consider at depth. When such detail is brought to attention, others usually defer to their mutually-validating autonomy, no one thinks it is relevant, or no one thinks you know how to write… ie failure to actively and fairly be judged because the jury cuts one way anyway.

Given this divide, there is clearly a higher potential for premature dismissal of issues being raised by someone who writes less neurotypically. This means that over time, there is growing failure to equally provide a frictionless experience for those who are made to be more affected by friction, and that only grows exponentially when the prevailing pubescent designer mindset seems to only every aspire to popularity in mainstream.

Solving this problem is not possible without expressing and documenting the skewed dynamics and the underlying causes, in ways that are motivating for people across the board — that it takes everyone!
