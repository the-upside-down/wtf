# Contributing

This repository is meant to organically evolve through community contributions. Let's stick to [issues][] to figure out the particular headings we want to explore.

## Getting Started

### Opening Issues

There are no firm rules, just a few recommendations:

1. Make sure that your issue is not already being addressed by thoroughly [searching](https://github.com/the-upside-down/wtf/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue).
   > Keeping all related discussions in one place leads to more informed decision making and resolution.
   
2. Look for inspiration by first reading and participating in [open issues](https://github.com/the-upside-down/wtf/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen).
   > Flow will affect the level of engagement on issues and the best way to offer it is to first get into it yourself.

3. Look for hints by exploring [closed issues](https://github.com/the-upside-down/wtf/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
   > Clarity will affect the potential outcomes of issues and the best way to offer it is to learn from previous examples.

4. Do not ask if you should open an issue, or how to do it right, just do your best.
   > Feedback will only come when you put things out and the best wat to get it is to not dwell in presumptions and doubts.
